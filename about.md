I'm a data scientist working in the Bay Area.

My professional CV is [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CV.pdf).

Old writing: [Cosmological Fine-Tuning and the Inverse Gambler's Fallacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fta.pdf) (2011) I argue against Roger White's [argument](https://web.mit.edu/rog/www/papers/fine_tuning.pdf) that the fine-tuning argument for multiple universes rests on fallacious probabilistic reasoning.
