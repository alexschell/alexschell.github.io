title: Temporal disaggregation with cubic splines in R
---


I implement cubic spline interpolation as described [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/index-of-services/index-of-services-annex-c--the-cubic-spline-interpolation-method.pdf) to disaggregate a low-frequency series to a higher-frequency series, subject to an additivity constraint (appropriate for flows such as GDP or indexes such as CPI).


The objective is to obtain a "smooth" curve whose integral over each period $$ [i−1,i] $$ equals the observed value $$ X_i $$. This is the constraint of _temporal additivity_:

$$ \int_{i-1}^{i} f(t) \,dt  = X_i $$

A cubic spline function $$ f(t) $$ is a piecewise cubic polynomial, specified as follows:

$$\begin{gather*}
f(t) = f_i(t) \text{ for } t \in [i-1, i] \\
\text{where }f_i(t) = a_i + b_i t + c_i t^2 + d_i t^3
\end{gather*}$$

To count as "smooth", our spline should at the very least be continuous (i.e. no level jumps) and continuously differentiable (i.e. no kinks -  its derivative should be continuous). That is, for each join $$ t \in {1, 2, \ldots, T−1} $$ where two adjacent cubic polynomials meet, they should have the same level as well as the same derivative:

$$\begin{gather*}
f_t(t) = f_{t+1}(t)
f'_t(t) = f'_{t+1}(t)
\text{for }t \in {1, 2, \ldots, T−1}
\end{gather*}$$

Continuity:

$$\begin{gather*}
f_t(t) = f_{t+1}(t) \\
a_t + b_t t + c_t t^2 + d_t t^3 = a_{t+1} + b_{t+1} t + c_{t+1} t^2 + d_{t+1} t^3 \\
a_t + b_t t + c_t t^2 + d_t t^3 - a_{t+1} - b_{t+1} t - c_{t+1} t^2 - d_{t+1} t^3 = 0
\end{gather*}$$

~~~ r
A1 = matrix(0, 4*k, k-1)
# Constraint (LHS)
for (i in 1:(k-1)){
	idx = (4*i-3):(4*(i+1))
	A1[idx,i] = c(1, i, i^2, i^3, -1, -i, -i^2, -i^3)
}
b1 = rep(0, k-1)  # RHS
~~~

Continuous differentiability (continuity of $$ f'(t) $$):

$$\begin{gather*}
f'_t(t) = f'_{t+1}(t) \\
b_t + 2 c_t t + 3 d_t t^2 = b_{t+1} + 2 c_{t+1} t + 3 d_{t+1} t^2 \\
b_t + 2 c_t t + 3 d_t t^2 - b_{t+1} - 2 c_{t+1} t - 3 d_{t+1} t^2 = 0
\end{gather*}$$

~~~ r
A2 = matrix(0, 4*k, k-1)
# Constraint (LHS)
for (i in 1:(k-1)){
	idx = (4*i-3):(4*(i+1))
	A2[idx,i] = c(0, 1, 2*i, 3*i^2, 0, -1, -2*i, -3*i^2)
}
b2 = rep(0, k-1)  # RHS
~~~

Additivity:

$$\begin{gather*}
\int_{i-1}^{i} f_i(t) \,dt = X_i \\
\int_{i-1}^{i} a_t + b_t t + c_t t^2 + d_t t^3 \,dt = X_i \\
a_i + \frac{b_i}{2}[i^2 - (i-1)^2] + \frac{c_i}{3}[i^3 - (i-1)^3] + \frac{d_i}{4}[i^4 - (i-1)^4] = X_i
\end{gather*}$$

~~~ r
A3 = matrix(0, 4*k, k)
# Constraint (LHS)
for (i in 1:k){
    idx = (4*i - 3):(4*i)
    A3[idx, i] = c(1, (1/2)*(i^2-(i-1)^2), (1/3)*(i^3-(i-1)^3),
		   (1/4)*(i^4-(i-1)^4))
}
b3 = x  # RHS

A = cbind(A1, A2, A3)
b = c(b1, b2, b3)
~~~

Subject to the above constraints, we want to minimize the squared second derivative at the cutpoints:

$$\begin{gather*}
\text{min}\sum{i=1}{k}(\frac{\partial^2 f_i}{\partial t^2})^2 \\
\text{min}\sum{i=1}{k}4c_i^2 + 12(2i-1)c_i d_i + 12(3i^2 - 3i +1)d^2
\end{gather*}$$

~~~ r
# Objective function
d = rep(0, 4*k)  # no linear terms
D = matrix(0, 4*k, 4*k)  # quadratic terms
for (i in 1:k){
	tmp = matrix(c(4, 12*(2*i-1), 12*(2*i-1), 12*(3*i^2 - 3*i + 1)),
		     2, 2)
	idx = (4*i-1):(4*i)
	D[idx,idx] = tmp
}
~~~
